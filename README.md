# Oadat-ldm
Oadat-ldm provides diffusion-based methods to adapt synthetic forearm optoacoustic data to experimental-like data, presented in Latent Diffusion Model for Domain Adaptation in Optoacoustic Data. The data used in this work, OADAT, is a public dataset presented in OADAT: Experimental and Synthetic Clinical Optoacoustic Data for Standardized Image Processing.
